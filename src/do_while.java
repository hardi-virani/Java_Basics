//QUESTION!!!ðŸ’¥
//Write a program that uses a do-while loop to read integer values from the user until a value between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is entered.

//always understand the question. Before this current commit, I made a mistake the only number between, 1 to 100 are allowed, but then I realize that it says UNTIL.
// always read question perfectly.
